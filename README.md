# Facebook-Content-Poster-Bot-Python-Pyppeteer-
This project is a **Facebook content automation bot** built with **Python** and **Pyppeteer**.   It automatically posts **text content and images** to your Facebook timeline using your **saved login profile**.   Users only need to **store their post data in a CSV file** (like text and image paths), and the bot handles posting automatically.
